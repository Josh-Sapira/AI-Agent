# Baseball AI Wrapper
This is a wrapper I made to answer baseball related questions using Ollama's Llama3.2 model. To create a working virtual environment for this project, run the following: </br>
```bash
python3 -m venv venv # create venv if it doesn't exist
. ./venv/bin/activate # activate venv
pip3 install -r requirements.txt # install necessary packages
```
Then, you can run the model from your terminal window by calling </br>
```bash
python3 ./main.py
```
The program will continually prompt you to provide it a question. At any point, you can enter 'q' to stop the program.
